The file `data.csv` contains data about users. Write a script to build a model that predicts the binary feature using all other features as inputs. The model should generalise to new users and you should estimate how well it will generalise.

Please submit your script, output (including the estimated generalisation performance) and supporting files in an easy to read format e.g. jupyter notebooks, text files, pdf etc.

Creating the highest performing model is not important. Easy to read code and output and accurate estimation of the performance of the model are important.
