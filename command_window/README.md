There are two challenges included in this folder; the coding challenge and the data science challenge. Please complete both challenges but focus on the challenge which you think will best demonstrate your skills. For the challenge you do not focus on (if any), here are some acceptable shortcuts.

#### Data science challenge

The most important aspect of this challenge is the accurate estimation of the generalisation performance for new users. Otherwise, feel free to make lazy / arbitrary decisions (please mark them as such) such as ignoring features, selecting performance metrics and not being thorough in model search.

#### Coding challenge

It is fine to only focus on the first part of the challenge i.e. the implementation of `+`. Also, feel free to ignore the command line specifics if you are unfamiliar with this.
